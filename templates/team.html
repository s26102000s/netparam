                    <p class="text-justify">The term MEAN Stack refers to a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used to develop web applications. MEAN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and Node.js. The MEAN Stack enables you to use JavaScript on both, front- and back-end.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        There are four main building blocks of every full-stack MEAN application:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MongoDB: a schema-less (document-oriented) NoSQL database</li>
                        <li>Express.js: a server-side JavaScript framework running on top of Node.js</li>
                        <li>Angular: a browser-independent MVC JavaScript UI framework</li>
                        <li>Node.js: a server-side JavaScript run-time based upon Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine</li>
                    </ul>
